**Climate Risk Assessment for Colombia using CLIMADA**

## Overview
**CLIMADACOL** is a research-oriented repository that implements a **CLIMADA-based workflow** for assessing **climate-related hazards, exposure, vulnerability, and resilience** in Colombia, with a primary focus on **rural basins and territorial systems**.  

The project is developed within the framework of the **SDG Nexus (climate–land–development)** and supports **reproducible, spatially explicit risk analysis**.

The repository consolidates **data extraction, preprocessing, hazard construction, and exposure modeling** using custom Python code fully compatible with **CLIMADA**.

---

## Objectives
- Implement a **standardized CLIMADA workflow** for climate risk assessment in Colombia  
- Analyze **spatial heterogeneity and multiscale climate variability**  
- Integrate **land-use and territorial exposure** into climate risk models  
- Prepare the groundwork for **deep learning–based extensions** to enhance multiscale representation  

---

## Methodological Framework
The project follows the **CLIMADA gold-standard workflow**:


### Key Features
- Climate data ingestion from **raster and NetCDF formats**  
- **Event-based hazard** construction  
- **Spatially explicit exposure** modeling  
- **Modular and reproducible** Python code
